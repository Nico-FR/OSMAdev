\title{insert a DNA segment into another DNAsegment}
\usage{
insDNA(DNA.string1, DNA.string2, window, breakpoint, fpos = "center")
}
\arguments{
\item{DNA.string1}{DNA input as DNAstring object to be inserted.}

\item{DNA.string2}{DNA input as DNAstring object (e.g chromosome sequence) where the insertion will take place.}

\item{window}{output size in bp. E.g, for +/-0.5 Mb of each sequences, use 1 Mb.}

\item{breakpoint}{position in bp of the breakpoint (i.e position where the insertion occurs) on DNA.string2 sequence. If breakpoint = 11, the insertion is realised between bp number 10 and 11.}

\item{fpos}{final position in bp of the insertion according to the output sequence. By default fpos = "center" to center the insertion on the put√ªt sequence.}
}
\value{
DNAstring
}
\description{
From two DNA sequence (e.g. chromosome), the function export a segment from the first DNA sequence (DNA.string1) into the second DNA sequence (DNA.string2).
}
\details{
By default the breakpoint of the output sequence is the middle of window. For example, if window is 10 bp, the breakpoint is between base pair number 5 and 6.
}
\examples{
DNA.seq1 = Biostrings::DNAString("GG")
DNA.seq2 = Biostrings::DNAString("AAAAACCCCCTTTTTAAAAA")

#output of 10bp with the insertion in the middle of the output:
insDNA(DNA.string1 = DNA.seq1, DNA.string2 = DNA.seq2, window = 10, breakpoint = 11, fpos = "center")

#output of 10bp with the insertion at 6bp of output:
insDNA(DNA.string1 = DNA.seq1, DNA.string2 = DNA.seq2, window = 10, breakpoint = 11, fpos = 6)
